No, Reguli-Falsi is not always better than the bisection method. Although, RF resulted in smaller residual value than bisect,
in the last test with interval [1,2], RF used almost 5x more iterations than bisect, and both approximated the same root with
very small residual. Therefore RF required more computations than the bisect, saying bisect may be more benefitial than
RF when dealing with larger intervals or if the initial points are far from a solution.
