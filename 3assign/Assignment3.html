<h3>Theory Problems </h3>
<strong>[T1]</strong> Devise a Newton iteration for computing the cube root of any positive real number.
	In particular, determine the specific \( g(x) \) so that the iteration \(x_{k+1} = g ( x_k ) \) converges to the cube root of any positive real number (assuming a sufficiently close initial iterate). 
<br />
<br />
<strong>[T2] </strong><B>(a)</B> Give an example of a function for which the size of the residual at an approximate root,  \(x_{k}\), will <I>over</I> estimate the error in that root
	<P>\(\qquad\) <B>(b)</B> Give an example of a function for which the size of the residual at an approximate root, \(x_{k}\), 
	will <I>under</I> estimate the error in that root</P>
	<P>\(\qquad\) <B>(c)</B> What general property should the function posses near the root so that the size of the residual is
	a good indicator of the error at an approximate root?</P>
	<P><strong>[T3]</strong> One modification of Newton's method that avoids the computation of the derivative is to use \(f^{\, \prime }( x_0 ) \)
	in the Newton iteration, rather than \(f^{\, \prime }( x_k ) \)
	 (where \(x_0\) is the initial iterate). Show that the
	order of convergence of the resulting method is 1. </P>
	<h3>Computational Problems</h3>
<strong>[C1]</strong> This problem requires you to work with the sequence of approximate roots generated by a root-finding method. You
	may use the script <A HREF="newtonRoot.R"></A><A HREF="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~anderson/151A_2018/Assign3/newtonRoot.m">newtonRoot.m</A> as a starting
	point for your work. You will be using the technique described in class to empirically determine the order of convergence
	for two different root finding methods. The two methods are
	 <UL>
	   <LI>Newton's method.
	  <LI>A modified Newton's method. In this method you use the Newton iteration, but with \(f^{\, \prime }( x_0 ) \)
	 instead
		of  \(f^{\, \prime }( x_k ) \) for the derivative at the kth step. (\(x_0\) is the initial iterate).
	</UL>
	<P><B>(a)</B> For each method compute the positive root of \(f(x) = x^2 - 3 \). Use a starting guess of 5.0.
	Print out, and save in a text file, the <B>error</B> in the approximate root for each iteration. Stop your computation
	when the residual is less than \(1 \times 10^{-12} \).</P>
	<P><B>(b)</B> Using the values of the error for each iterate, estimate the order of convergence for each of the
	methods, and save the results to a plain text file. Do your results agree with the theoretical predictions?</P>
	<P>Tip: Use the computer to do the computation to estimate the order of convergence. For example, you could capture the root approximations in a vector and then use a loop to carry out the requisite computations. 
    <h4>Submit In Class</h4>
<UL>
	<LI>The answers to the theoretical problems, <strong>[T1]-[T3]</strong>,  in class on Friday, January 26th. <br />
</UL> 
<h4>Upload to CCLE</h4>
<UL>
	<LI>A listing of the codes you used, the errors for the approximations generated<strong> [C1](a)</strong>, and your convergence order estimates
	for each method [ <strong>C1](b)</strong>. Don't forget to comment upon the agreement (or non-agreement) of your computational results with the theoretical predictions.
