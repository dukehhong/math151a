We can see that the estimated convergence rates of centered difference is around 2 in the first few iterations.
This agrees with the fact that the order of centered difference is 2. However as more iterations goes on, 
the estimated order and error start to tend to 0. This is due to catastrophic cancellation and the limitations 
of floats; to figure out the error, we subtract the actual and estimated value which leads to catastrophic cancellation when 
both values are small.
